<p>The <span class="smcap">Shipwreck</span> is one of those happy productions
in which talent is seen in so exquisite
adaptation to the nature of the subject, that it is
difficult to determine whether the author is the
most indebted to his subject, or the subject to
the author. No one who had not passed through
the circumstances which Falconer describes,
could have painted them as he has done; and of
the comparatively few who have had the opportunity
of drinking in the fearful inspiration of
such scenes, and survived to tell of them, Falconer
is the first who appears to have possessed the
genius requisite to retain and embody the impression,
with the vigour of imagination and the
fidelity of memory. It was not more necessary<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
that he should be a poet, than that he should be a
seaman. He was eminently both; and the Poem
is as perfect in every technical excellence, as it
is in respect to the simplicity of its plan, the
classical elegance of its composition, and the
pathos of its narrative. It is altogether a unique
production.</p>

<p>Falconer originally designed the Poem, (as
appears from an advertisement prefixed to the
second edition, published in 1764,) for the entertainment
of “the gentlemen of the sea;” but
he complains that they had not formed one tenth
of the purchasers. He printed that edition in a
cheaper form, expressly with a view to render it
more acceptable to the inferior officers. Falconer
was thoroughly the seaman; he was warmly
attached to the profession, and prided himself
more on his nautical science than on his literary
talents. The author of the <span class="smcap">Shipwreck</span> compiled
a “Universal Dictionary of the Marine,”
a work which cost him years of extraordinary<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
application. The <span class="smcap">Shipwreck</span> is said to comprise
within itself the rudiments of navigation, so
as even to claim to be considered as a grammar of
the nautical science. The correctness of the
rules and maxims laid down in the Poem, for the
conduct of a ship under circumstances of perilous
emergency, render it extremely valuable to
the seaman. The notes originally affixed to the
Poem, in explanation of the technical terms, the
frequent introduction and euphonous arrangement
of which, form so striking a peculiarity of
the composition, were thought necessary by the
Author, on account of there being, at that time,
no modern dictionaries to which he could refer
the reader, without forfeiting, by his implied commendation
of them, his claim to the professional
character he had assumed,—a claim of which he
professes himself to be much more tenacious,
than of his reputation as a poet.</p>

<p>Fresh-water critics venture out of their element
in entering upon a minute examination of such a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
poem as this. The care with which it appears to
have been elaborated, has, however, left little for
the invidious notice of criticism. In a few instances,
the hand of correction has been injudiciously
applied in the editions of the Poem
subsequent to its first appearance; it is conjectured,
that some of the alterations in the third
edition, which are of this nature, are to be
attributed to his having left the final revision to
his friend Mallet, who, although a poet, was not a
seaman. If the style of the Poem is faulty in any
respect, it is in that of the too ambitious phraseology,
by which it seems to have been Falconer’s
effort to sustain the epic dignity of the narrative.
Into this fault the models of the day were
adapted to seduce any young writer, and the
versification he adopted, presents a constant
temptation to artificial and inverted forms of
expression. Thus, for instance, to weigh anchor,
is paraphrased in the following line:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Or win the anchor from its dark abode.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span></p>
<p>The frequency of the classical allusions, by
which also the Poet probably intended to render
his work more <i>secundum artem</i> poetical, is
justified by their local propriety. As suggested
by the surrounding scenery, they seem perfectly
natural, and they are introduced, generally, with
considerable skill and effect. The most pleasing
parts of the Poem, however, are those in which
the narration is characterized by all the simplicity
of the seaman, rather than by the embellishments
of a half-learned taste.</p>

<p>Short and simple are the annals of poor
<span class="smcap">Arion’s</span> history. He was born at Edinburgh,
about the year 1730. His father was a poor but
industrious barber, who had to maintain a large
family, under the distressing circumstance of all
his children, with the single exception of William,
being either deaf or dumb. Reading English,
writing, and a little arithmetic, comprised the
whole of Falconer’s education, although he afterwards
acquired some knowledge of the French,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
Spanish, and Italian languages, and, it is added,
even of the German. When very young, he entered
on board a merchant vessel at Leith, in which he
served an apprenticeship. He was afterwards
servant to Campbell, the author of Lexiphanes,
when purser of a ship, who is stated to have
taken considerable pains in improving the mind
of the young seaman, and to have subsequently
felt a pride in boasting of his scholar. At what
time the calamitous event occurred, which furnished
the subject of the <span class="smcap">Shipwreck</span>, has not
been ascertained: he was then, it appears, employed
in the Levant trade. He continued in
the merchant service till 1762. In that year, the
<span class="smcap">Shipwreck</span> made its first appearance, in quarto,
dedicated to his Royal Highness Edward, Duke of
York, who had hoisted his flag as rear-admiral of
the blue, on board the Princess Amelia, of eighty
guns, attached to the fleet under Sir Edward
Hawke. The Poem immediately took with the
public, and Falconer, having, as it is said, at the
Duke’s recommendation, quitted the merchant<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
service for the royal navy, was soon after rated a
midshipman on board the Royal George.</p>

<p>At the peace of 1763, the Royal George was
paid off, and Falconer, in the course of the same
year, was appointed purser of the Glory frigate.
Soon after this, he married a young lady of the
name of Hicks, who survived him. From the
Glory, he was, in 1767, appointed to the Swiftsure.</p>

<p>In 1764, he published a new edition of his Poem,
in octavo, corrected and enlarged, and, in the following
year, a political satire on Lord Chatham,
Wilkes, and Churchill, of which it is enough to
say, that had Falconer never written any thing
but satire, his name would long since have been
forgotten. His Universal Dictionary of the Marine,
was published in 1769, at which period he
was resident in the metropolis, supporting himself
chiefly by his literary exertions. Among other
resources, he is said to have received a pittance<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
from writing in the Critical Review, under his
countryman Mallet. He had received, the preceding
year, proposals from his friend Mr. Murray,
to enter into company with him as a bookseller,
on his taking Mr. Sandby’s business in Fleet-street;
it does not appear from what cause he
was led to decline the offer. While he was preparing
to publish a third edition of the <span class="smcap">Shipwreck</span>,
he obtained the highly advantageous
appointment of purser to the Aurora frigate,
Captain Lee, which was ordered to carry out Mr.
Vansittart and the other Commissioners to India,
with the promise of being made their private
secretary. The catastrophe is well known. The
Aurora frigate sailed on the 30th of September,
1769, left the Cape on the 27th of December, and
was heard of no more. It is the most probable
opinion, that she foundered in the Mozambique
channel, the dangers of which, the captain, in
spite, as it is said, of remonstrances, was rash
enough, although a stranger to its navigation, to
encounter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span></p>

<p>In 1773, a black was examined before the East
India Directors, who affirmed that he was one of
five persons who had been saved from the wreck
of the Aurora, and that she had been cast away
on a reef of rocks off Mocoa.</p>

<p>To these particulars, for which the public are
chiefly indebted to the assiduous researches of the
Rev. James Stanier Clarke, it may be added, on
the same authority, that Falconer was, in his person,
about five feet seven inches in height, of a
thin light make, hard featured, and weather-beaten,
of blunt and aukward manners, but cheerful,
kind, and generous. He was, however, inclined
to be satirical, and delighted in controversy:
strange characteristics of a man who was a
thorough seaman and a poet!</p>

<h3>CANTO I.</h3>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">I. A ship from Egypt, o’er the deep impelled</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">By guiding winds, her course for Venice held.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of famed Britannia were the gallant crew,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And from that isle her name the vessel drew;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The wayward steps of Fortune they pursued,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And sought in certain ills imagined good:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Though cautioned oft her slippery path to shun,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Hope still with promised joys allured them on;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And, while they listened to her winning lore,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The softer scenes of peace could please no more:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Long absent they from friends and native home</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The cheerless ocean were inured to roam;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Yet Heaven, in pity to severe distress,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Had crowned each painful voyage with success;</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Still to compensate toils and hazards past</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Restored them to maternal plains at last.</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Thrice had the sun to rule the varying year</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Across the equator rolled his flaming sphere,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Since last the vessel spread her ample sail</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">From Albion’s coast, obsequious to the gale;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">She o’er the spacious flood from shore to shore</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Unwearying wafted her commercial store;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The richest ports of Afric she had viewed,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thence to fair Italy her course pursued;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Had left behind Trinacria’s burning isle,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And visited the margin of the Nile:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And now, that winter deepens round the Pole,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The circling voyage hastens to its goal;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">They, blind to Fate’s inevitable law,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">No dark event to blast their hope foresaw,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But from gay Venice soon expect to steer</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For Britain’s coast, and dread no perils near;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Inflamed by Hope, their throbbing hearts elate</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Ideal pleasures vainly antedate,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Before whose vivid intellectual ray</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Distress recedes, and danger melts away:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Already British coasts appear to rise,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The chalky cliffs salute their longing eyes;</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Each to his breast, where floods of rapture roll,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Embracing strains the mistress of his soul;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Nor less o’erjoyed, with sympathetic truth,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Each faithful maid expects th’ approaching youth:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In distant souls congenial passions glow,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And mutual feelings mutual bliss bestow—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Such shadowy happiness their thoughts employ,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Illusion all, and visionary joy!</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Thus time elapsed, while o’er the pathless tide</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Their ship through Grecian seas the pilots guide.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Occasion called to touch at Candia’s shore,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Which, blest with favouring winds, they soon explore;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The haven enter, borne before the gale,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Despatch their commerce, and prepare to sail.</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Eternal powers! what ruins from afar</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Mark the fell track of desolating war!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Here arts and commerce with auspicious reign</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Once breathed sweet influence on the happy plain;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">While o’er the lawn, with dance and festive song,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Young Pleasure led the jocund Hours along;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In gay luxuriance Ceres too was seen</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To crown the vallies with eternal green:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For wealth, for valour, courted and revered,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">What Albion is, fair Candia then appeared.—</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Ah! who the flight of ages can revoke? <span class="bracket">}</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The free-born spirit of her sons is broke, <span class="bracket">}</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">They bow to Ottoman’s imperious yoke; <span class="bracket">}</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">No longer Fame their drooping heart inspires,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For stern Oppression quenched its genial fires:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Though still her fields, with golden harvests crown’d,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Supply the barren shores of Greece around,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Sharp penury afflicts these wretched isles,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">There Hope ne’er dawns, and Pleasure never smiles;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The vassal wretch contented drags his chain,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And hears his famished babes lament in vain;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">These eyes have seen the dull reluctant soil</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A seventh year mock the weary labourer’s toil.—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">No blooming Venus, on the desert shore,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Now views with triumph captive gods adore;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">No lovely Helens now with fatal charms</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Excite th’ avenging chiefs of Greece to arms;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">No fair Penelopes enchant the eye,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For whom contending kings were proud to die;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Here sullen Beauty sheds a twilight ray,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">While Sorrow bids her vernal bloom decay;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Those charms, so long renowned in classic strains,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Had dimly shone on Albion’s happier plains!</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
    <div class="verse indent2">Now, in the southern hemisphere, the sun,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Through the bright Virgin, and the Scales, had run,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And on th’ ecliptic wheeled his winding way</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Till the fierce Scorpion felt his flaming ray.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Four days becalmed the vessel here remains,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And yet no hopes of aiding wind obtains;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For sickening vapours lull the air to sleep,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And not a breeze awakes the silent deep:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">This, when th’ autumnal equinox is o’er,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And Phœbus in the north declines no more,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The watchful mariner, whom Heaven informs,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Oft deems the prelude of approaching storms.—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">No dread of storms the master’s soul restrain,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A captive fettered to the oar of gain:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His anxious heart, impatient of delay,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Expects the winds to sail from Candia’s bay,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Determined, from whatever point they rise,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To trust his fortune to the seas and skies.</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Thou living ray of intellectual fire,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Whose voluntary gleams my verse inspire,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Ere yet the deepening incidents prevail,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Till roused attention feel our plaintive tale;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Record whom chief among the gallant crew</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Th’ unblest pursuit of fortune hither drew:</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Can sons of Neptune, generous, brave, and bold,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In pain and hazard toil for sordid gold?</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">They can! for gold, too oft with magic art,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Can rule the passions and corrupt the heart:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">This crowns the prosperous villain with applause,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To whom in vain sad Merit pleads her cause;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">This strews with roses Life’s perplexing road,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And leads the way to Pleasure’s soft abode;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">This spreads with slaughtered heaps the bloody plain,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And pours adventurous thousands o’er the main.</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">II. The stately ship, with all her daring band,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To skilful Albert owned the chief command:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Though trained in boisterous elements, his mind</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Was yet by soft humanity refined;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Each joy of wedded love, at home, he knew,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Aboard, confest the father of his crew!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Brave, liberal, just! the calm domestic scene</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Had o’er his temper breathed a gay serene:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Him Science taught by mystic lore to trace</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The planets wheeling in eternal race!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To mark the ship in floating balance held,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">By earth attracted, and by seas repell’d;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Or point her devious track through climes unknown,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That leads to every shore and every zone:</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">He saw the moon through Heaven’s blue concave glide,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And into motion charm th’ expanding tide,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">While earth impetuous round her axle rolls,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Exalts her watery zone, and sinks the Poles;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Light and attraction, from their genial source,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He saw still wandering with diminished force;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">While on the margin of declining day</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Night’s shadowy cone reluctant melts away—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Inured to peril, with unconquered soul,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The chief beheld tempestuous oceans roll;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">O’er the wild surge when dismal shades preside,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His equal skill the lonely bark could guide;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His genius, ever for th’ event prepared,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Rose with the storm, and all its dangers shared.</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Rodmond the next degree to Albert bore,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A hardy son of England’s farthest shore,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Where bleak Northumbria pours her savage train</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In sable squadrons o’er the northern main;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That, with her pitchy entrails stored, resort,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A sooty tribe, to fair Augusta’s port:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Where’er in ambush lurk the fatal sands,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">They claim the danger, proud of skilful bands;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For while with darkling course their vessels sweep</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The winding shore, or plough the faithless deep,</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">O’er bar, and shelve, the watery path they sound</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With dexterous arm, sagacious of the ground:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Fearless they combat every hostile wind,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Wheeling in mazy tracks, with course inclined.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Expert to moor where terrors line the road,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Or win the anchor from its dark abode;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But drooping, and relaxed, in climes afar,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Tumultuous and undisciplined in war.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Such Rodmond was; by learning unrefined,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That oft enlightens to corrupt the mind.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Boisterous of manners; trained in early youth</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To scenes that shame the conscious cheek of truth;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To scenes that nature’s struggling voice control,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And freeze compassion rising in the soul:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Where the grim hell-hounds, prowling round the shore,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With foul intent the stranded bark explore;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Deaf to the voice of woe, her decks they board,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">While tardy justice slumbers o’er her sword.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Th’ indignant Muse, severely taught to feel,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Shrinks from a theme she blushes to reveal.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Too oft example, armed with poisons fell,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Pollutes the shrine where mercy loves to dwell:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thus Rodmond, trained by this unhallowed crew,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The sacred social passions never knew.</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Unskilled to argue, in dispute yet loud,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Bold without caution, without honours proud;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In art unschooled, each veteran rule he prized,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And all improvement haughtily despised.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Yet, though full oft to future perils blind,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With skill superior glowed his daring mind,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Through snares of death the reeling bark to guide,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When midnight shades involve the raging tide.</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">To Rodmond, next in order of command,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Succeeds the youngest of our naval band:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But what avails it to record a name</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That courts no rank among the sons of fame;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Whose vital spring had just began to bloom,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When o’er it sorrow spread her sickening gloom?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">While yet a stripling, oft with fond alarms</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His bosom danced to Nature’s boundless charms;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">On him fair Science dawned in happier hour,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Awakening into bloom young Fancy’s flower:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But soon Adversity, with freezing blast,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The blossom withered, and the dawn o’ercast.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Forlorn of heart, and by severe decree</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Condemned reluctant to the faithless sea,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With long farewell he left the laurel grove,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Where science and the tuneful sisters rove.</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Hither he wandered, anxious to explore</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Antiquities of nations now no more;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To penetrate each distant realm unknown,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And range excursive o’er th’ untravelled zone:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In vain—for rude Adversity’s command</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Still on the margin of each famous land,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With unrelenting ire his steps opposed,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And every gate of hope against him closed.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Permit my verse, ye blest Pierian train!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To call Arion this ill-fated swain;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For like that bard unhappy, on his head</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Malignant stars their hostile influence shed:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Both, in lamenting numbers, o’er the deep</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With conscious anguish taught the harp to weep:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And both the raging surge in safety bore</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Amid destruction, panting to the shore:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">This last, our tragic story from the wave</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of dark oblivion, haply, yet may save;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With genuine sympathy may yet complain,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">While sad Remembrance bleeds at every vein.</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">These, chief among the ship’s conducting train,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Her path explored along the deep domain;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Trained to command, and range the swelling sail,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Whose varying force conforms to every gale.</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Charged with the commerce, hither also came</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A gallant youth, Palemon was his name:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A father’s stern resentment doomed to prove,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He came the victim of unhappy love!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His heart for Albert’s beauteous daughter bled,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For her a sacred flame his bosom fed:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Nor let the wretched slaves of folly scorn,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">This genuine passion, Nature’s eldest born!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">’Twas his with lasting anguish to complain,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">While blooming Anna mourned the cause in vain</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Graceful of form, by nature taught to please,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of power to melt the female breast with ease;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To her Palemon told his tender tale</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Soft as the voice of summer’s evening gale;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His soul, where moral truth spontaneous grew,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">No guilty wish, no cruel passion knew:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Though tremblingly alive to Nature’s laws,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Yet ever firm to Honour’s sacred cause;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">O’erjoyed he saw her lovely eyes relent,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The blushing maiden smiled with sweet consent.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Oft in the mazes of a neighbouring grove</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Unheard they breathed alternate vows of love:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">By fond society their passion grew,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Like the young blossom fed with vernal dew;</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">While their chaste souls possessed the pleasing pains</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That truth improves, and virtue ne’er restrains.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In evil hour th’ officious tongue of fame</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Betrayed the secret of their mutual flame.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With grief and anger struggling in his breast,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Palemon’s father heard the tale confest;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Long had he listened with Suspicion’s ear,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And learnt, sagacious, this event to fear.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Too well, fair youth! thy liberal heart he knew,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A heart to Nature’s warm impressions true:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Full oft his wisdom strove with fruitless toil</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With avarice to pollute that generous soil;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That soil impregnated with nobler seed</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Refused the culture of so rank a weed.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Elate with wealth in active Commerce won,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And basking in the smile of Fortune’s sun;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For many freighted ships from shore to shore,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Their wealthy charge by his appointment bore;</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">She wept the terrors of the fearful wave,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Too oft, alas! the wandering lover’s grave:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With soft persuasion I dispelled her fear,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And from her cheek beguiled the falling tear,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">While dying fondness languished in her eyes,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">She poured her soul to heaven in suppliant sighs:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">‘Look down with pity, O ye powers above!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Who hear the sad complaint of bleeding love;</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Ye, who the secret laws of fate explore,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Alone can tell if he returns no more;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Or if the hour of future joy remain,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Long-wished atonement of long-suffered pain,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Bid every guardian minister attend,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And from all ill the much-loved youth defend.’</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With grief o’erwhelmed we parted twice in vain,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And, urged by strong attraction, met again.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">At last, by cruel fortune torn apart</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">While tender passion beat in either heart,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Our eyes transfixed with agonizing look,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">One sad farewell, one last embrace we took.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Forlorn of hope the lovely maid I left,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Pensive and pale, of every joy bereft:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">She to her silent couch retired to weep,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Whilst I embarked, in sadness, on the deep.”</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">His tale thus closed, from sympathy of grief</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Palemon’s bosom felt a sweet relief;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To mutual friendship thus sincerely true,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">No secret wish, or fear, their bosoms knew;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In mutual hazards oft severely tried,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Nor hope, nor danger, could their love divide.</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Ye tender maids! in whose pathetic souls</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Compassion’s sacred stream impetuous rolls,</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Whose warm affections exquisitely feel</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The secret wound you tremble to reveal;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Ah! may no wanderer of the stormy main</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Pour through your breasts the soft delicious bane;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">May never fatal tenderness approve</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The fond effusions of their ardent love:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Oh! warned, avoid the path that leads to woe,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Where thorns, and baneful weeds, alternate grow:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Let them severer stoic nymphs possess,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Whose stubborn passions feel no soft distress.</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Now as the youths returning o’er the plain</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Approached the lonely margin of the main,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">First, with attention rouzed, Arion eyed</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The graceful lover, formed in Nature’s pride:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His frame the happiest symmetry displayed,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And locks of waving gold his neck arrayed;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In every look the Paphian graces shine,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Soft breathing o’er his cheek their bloom divine:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With lightened heart he smiled serenely gay,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Like young Adonis, or the son of May.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Not Cytherea from a fairer swain</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Received her apple on the Trojan plain.</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">IV. The Sun’s bright orb, declining all serene,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Now glanced obliquely o’er the woodland scene:</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Creation smiles around; on every spray</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The warbling birds exalt their evening lay:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Blithe skipping o’er yon hill, the fleecy train</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Join the deep chorus of the lowing plain;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The golden lime, and orange, there were seen</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">On fragrant branches of perpetual green;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The crystal streams that velvet meadows lave,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To the green ocean roll with chiding wave.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The glassy ocean hushed forgets to roar,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But trembling murmurs on the sandy shore;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And lo! his surface lovely to behold</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Glows in the west, a sea of living gold!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">While, all above, a thousand liveries gay</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The skies with pomp ineffable array.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Arabian sweets perfume the happy plains;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Above, beneath, around, enchantment reigns!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">While glowing vesper leads the starry train,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And night slow draws her veil o’er land and main,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Emerging clouds the azure east invade,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And wrap the lucid spheres in gradual shade;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">While yet the songsters of the vocal grove,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With dying numbers tune the soul to love:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With joyful eyes th’ attentive master sees</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Th’ auspicious omens of an eastern breeze.</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Round the charged bowl the sailors form a ring;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">By turns recount the wondrous tale, or sing,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As love, or battle, hardships of the main,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Or genial wine, awake the homely strain:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Then some the watch of night alternate keep,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The rest lie buried in oblivious sleep.</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Deep midnight now involves the livid skies,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When eastern breezes, yet enervate, rise;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The waning moon behind a watery shroud</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Pale glimmered o’er the long protracted cloud;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A mighty halo round her silver throne,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With parting meteors crossed, portentous shone:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">This in the troubled sky full oft prevails,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Oft deemed a signal of tempestuous gales.</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">While young Arion sleeps, before his sight</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Tumultuous swim the visions of the night:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Now, blooming Anna with her happy swain</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Approached the sacred hymeneal fane;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Anon, tremendous lightnings flash between,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And funeral pomp, and weeping loves are seen:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Now with Palemon, up a rocky steep,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Whose summit trembles o’er the roaring deep,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With painful step he climbed; while far above</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Sweet Anna charmed them with the voice of love:</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Then sudden from the slippery height they fell,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">While dreadful yawned, beneath, the jaws of hell.—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Amid this fearful trance, a thundering sound</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He hears, and thrice the hollow decks rebound;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Upstarting from his couch on deck he sprung,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thrice with shrill note the boatswain’s whistle rung:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">‘All hands unmoor!’ proclaims a boisterous cry;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">‘All hands unmoor!’ the caverned rocks reply:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Roused from repose aloft the sailors swarm,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And with their levers soon the windlass arm:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The order given, up springing with a bound, <span class="bracket">}</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">They fix the bars, and heave the windlass round; <span class="bracket">}</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">At every turn the clanging pauls resound: <span class="bracket">}</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Up-torn reluctant from its oozy cave</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The ponderous anchor rises o’er the wave.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">High on the slippery masts the yards ascend,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And far abroad the canvass wings extend.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Along the glassy plain the vessel glides,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">While azure radiance trembles on her sides;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The lunar rays in long reflection gleam,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With silver deluging the fluid stream.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Levant and Thracian gales alternate play,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Then in th’ Egyptian quarter die away.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A calm ensues; adjacent shores they dread,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The boats, with rowers manned, are sent ahead;</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">With cordage fastened to the lofty prow</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Aloof to sea the stately ship they tow;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The nervous crew their sweeping oars extend,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And pealing shouts the shore of Candia rend:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Success attends their skill! the danger’s o’er:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The port is doubled, and beheld no more.</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Now morn with gradual pace advanced on high,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Whitening with orient beam the twilight sky:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">She comes not in refulgent pomp arrayed,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But frowning stern, and wrapt in sullen shade.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Above incumbent mists, tall Ida’s height,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Tremendous rock! emerges on the sight;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">North-east, a league, the isle of Standia bears,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And westward, Freschin’s woody cape appears.</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">In distant angles while the transient gales</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Alternate blow, they trim the flagging sails;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The drowsy air attentive to retain,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As from unnumbered points it sweeps the main.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Now swelling stud-sails on each side extend,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Then stay-sails sidelong to the breeze ascend;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">While all, to court the veering winds, are placed</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With yards alternate square, and sharply braced.</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">The dim horizon lowering vapours shroud,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And blot the sun yet struggling in the cloud;</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Through the wide atmosphere condensed with haze,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His glaring orb emits a sanguine blaze.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The pilots now their azimuth attend,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">On which all courses, duly formed, depend:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The compass placed to catch the rising ray,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The quadrant’s shadows studious they survey;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Along the arch the gradual index slides,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">While Phœbus down the vertic circle glides;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Now seen on ocean’s utmost verge to swim,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He sweeps it vibrant with his nether limb.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thus height, and polar distance are obtained,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Then latitude, and declination, gained;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In chiliads next th’ analogy is sought,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And on the sinical triangle wrought:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">By this magnetic variance is explored,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Just angles known, and polar truth restored.</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">The natives, while the ship departs their land,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Ashore with admiration gazing stand.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Majestically slow before the breeze</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">She moved triumphant o’er the yielding seas;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Her bottom through translucent waters shone,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">White as the clouds beneath the blaze of noon;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The bending wales their contrast next displayed,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">All fore and aft in polished jet arrayed.</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Britannia, riding awful on the prow,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Gazed o’er the vassal waves that rolled below:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Where’er she moved the vassal waves were seen</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To yield obsequious, and confess their queen.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Th’ imperial trident graced her dexter hand,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of power to rule the surge like Moses’ wand;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Th’ eternal empire of the main to keep,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And guide her squadrons o’er the trembling deep.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Her left, propitious, bore a mystic shield,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">There her bold genius in his floating car</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">O’er the wild billow hurls the storm of war:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And lo! the beasts that oft with jealous rage</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In bloody combat met, from age to age,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Tamed into union, yoked in Friendship’s chain,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Draw his proud chariot round the vanquished main:</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Shelves, rocks, and whirlpools, hideous to the view.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Th’ immortal shield from Neptune she received,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When first her head above the waters heaved;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Loose floated o’er her limbs an azure vest,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A figured scutcheon glittered on her breast;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">There from one parent soil, for ever young,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The blooming rose and hardy thistle sprung.</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Around her head an oaken wreath was seen,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Inwove with laurels of unfading green.</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Such was the sculptured prow; from van to rear</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Th’ artillery frowned, a black tremendous tier!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Embalmed with orient gum, above the wave</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The swelling sides a yellow radiance gave.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">On the broad stern, a pencil warm and bold,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That never servile rules of art controll’d,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">An allegoric tale on high pourtray’d;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">There a young hero, here a royal maid:</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Serene, yet firm; though mild, impressing awe:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Her nervous arm, inured to toils severe,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Brandished th’ unconquered Caledonian spear:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The dreadful falchion of the hills she wore, <span class="bracket">}</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Sung to the harp in many a tale of yore, <span class="bracket">}</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That oft her rivers dyed with hostile gore. <span class="bracket">}</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Blue was her rocky shield; her piercing eye</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Her crest, high-plumed, was rough with many a scar,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And o’er her helmet gleamed the northern star.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The warrior youth appeared of noble frame,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The hardy offspring of some rustic dame:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Loose o’er his shoulders hung the slackened bow,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Renowned in song, the terror of the foe!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The sword that oft the barbarous North defy’d,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The scourge of tyrants! glittered by his side:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Clad in refulgent arms in battle won,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The George emblazoned on his corselet shone;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Fast by his side was seen a golden lyre,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Pregnant with numbers of eternal fire;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Whose strings unlock the witches’ midnight spell,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Or waft rapt fancy through the gulphs of hell:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Struck with contagion, kindling fancy hears</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">The songs of heaven, the music of the spheres!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Borne on Newtonian wing through air she flies,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Where other suns to other systems rise.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">These front the scene conspicuous; overhead</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Albion’s proud oak his filial branches spread:</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Here, the bold native of her cliffs above,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Perched by the martial maid the bird of Jove;</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">There, on the watch, sagacious of his prey,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With eyes of fire, an English mastiff lay;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Yonder fair Commerce stretched her winged sail,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Here, frowned the god that wakes the living gale.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">High o’er the poop, the flattering winds unfurled</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Th’ imperial flag that rules the watery world.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Deep blushing <i>Armors</i> all the tops invest,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And warlike trophies either quarter drest:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Then towered the masts, the canvass swelled on high,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And waving streamers floated in the sky.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thus the rich vessel moves in trim array,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Like some fair virgin on her bridal day;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thus, like a swan, she cleaved the watery plain,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Hail, social horrors! like my fate severe:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Old ocean hail! beneath whose azure zone</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The secret deep lies unexplored, unknown.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Approach, ye brave companions of the sea!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And fearless view this awful scene with me.</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Ye native guardians of your country’s laws!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Ye brave assertors of her sacred cause!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The Muse invites you, judge if she depart,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Unequal, from the thorny rules of art;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In practice trained, and conscious of her power,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">She boldly moves to meet the trying hour:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Her voice attempting themes, before unknown</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To music, sings distresses all her own.</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">II. O’er the smooth bosom of the faithless tides,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Propelled by flattering gales, the vessel glides:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Rodmond exulting felt the auspicious wind,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And by a mystic charm its aim confin’d.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The thoughts of home, that o’er his fancy roll,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With trembling joy dilate Palemon’s soul;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Hope lifts his heart, before whose vivid ray</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Distress recedes, and danger melts away.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Tall Ida’s summit now more distant grew,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And Jove’s high hill was rising to the view:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When on the larboard quarter they descry</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A liquid column towering shoot on high;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The foaming base the angry whirlwinds sweep,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Where curling billows rouse the fearful deep:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Still round, and round, the fluid vortex flies,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Diffusing briny vapours o’er the skies.</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">This vast phenomenon, whose lofty head,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In Heaven immersed, embracing clouds o’erspread,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In spiral motion first, as seamen deem,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Swells, when the raging whirlwind sweeps the stream.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The swift volution, and th’ enormous train,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Let sages versed in Nature’s lore explain.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The horrid apparition still draws nigh,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And white with foam the whirling billows fly.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The guns were primed; the vessel northward veers,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Till her black battery on the column bears:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The nitre fired; and, while the dreadful sound</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Convulsive shook the slumbering air around,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The watery volume, trembling to the sky,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Burst down a dreadful deluge, from on high!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Th’ expanding ocean trembled as it fell,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And felt with swift recoil her surges swell;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But soon, this transient undulation o’er,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The sea subsides, the whirlwinds rage no more.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">While southward now th’ increasing breezes veer,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Dark clouds incumbent on their wings appear:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Ahead they see the consecrated grove</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of Cyprus, sacred once to Cretan Jove.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The ship beneath her lofty pressure reels,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And to the freshening gale still deeper heels.</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
    <div class="verse indent2">But now, beneath the lofty vessel’s stern,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A shoal of sportive dolphins they discern</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Beaming from burnished scales refulgent rays,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Till all the glowing ocean seems to blaze:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In curling wreaths they wanton on the tide,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Now bound aloft, now downward swiftly glide;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Awhile beneath the waves their tracks remain,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And burn in silver streams along the liquid plain.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Soon to the sport of death the crew repair,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Dart the long lance, or spread the baited snare.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">One in redoubling mazes wheels along,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And glides unhappy near the triple prong:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Rodmond, unerring, o’er his head suspends</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The barbed steel, and every turn attends;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Unerring aimed, the missile weapon flew,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And, plunging, struck the fatal victim through;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Th’ upturning points his ponderous bulk sustain,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">On deck he struggles with convulsive pain:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But while his heart the fatal javelin thrills,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And flitting life escapes in sanguine rills,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">What radiant changes strike th’ astonished sight!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">What glowing hues of mingled shade and light!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Not equal beauties gild the lucid west</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With parting beams all o’er profusely drest,</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Not lovelier colours paint the vernal dawn,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When orient dews impearl th’ enamelled lawn;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Than from his sides in bright suffusion flow,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That now with gold empyreal seem to glow;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Now in pellucid sapphires meet the view,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And emulate the soft celestial hue;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Now beam a flaming crimson on the eye,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And now assume the purple’s deeper dye:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But here description clouds each shining ray;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">What terms of art can Nature’s powers display!</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">The lighter sails, for summer winds and seas,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Are now dismissed, the straining masts to ease;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Swift on the deck the stud-sails all descend,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Which ready seamen from the yards unbend;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The boats then hoisted in are fixed on board,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And on the deck with fastening gripes secured.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The watchful ruler of the helm no more</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With fixed attention eyes th’ adjacent shore,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But by the oracle of truth below,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The wonderous magnet, guides the wayward prow.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The powerful sails, with steady breezes swelled,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Swift and more swift the yielding bark impelled:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Across her stem the parting waters run,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As clouds, by tempests wafted, pass the sun.</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Impatient thus she darts along the shore,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Till Ida’s mount, and Jove’s are seen no more;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And while aloof from Retimo she steers,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Maleca foreland full in front appears.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Wide o’er yon Isthmus stands the cypress grove,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That once inclosed the hallowed fane of Jove;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Here too, memorial of his name! is found</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A tomb in marble ruins on the ground:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">This gloomy tyrant, whose despotic sway</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Compelled the trembling nations to obey,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Through Greece for murder, rape, and incest known,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The Muses raised to high Olympus’ throne;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For oft, alas! their venal strains adorn</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The prince, whom blushing virtue holds in scorn:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Still Rome and Greece record his endless fame,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And hence yon mountain yet retains his name.</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">But see! in confluence borne before the blast,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Clouds rolled on clouds the dusky noon o’ercast:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The blackening ocean curls, the winds arise,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And the dark scud in swift succession flies.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">While the swoln canvass bends the masts on high,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Low in the wave the leeward cannon lie.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The master calls, to give the ship relief,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">‘The topsails lower, and form a single reef!’</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Each lofty yard with slackened cordage reels;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Rattle the creaking blocks and ringing wheels.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Down the tall masts the topsails sink amain,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Are manned and reefed, then hoisted up again.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">More distant grew receding Candia’s shore,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And southward of the west Cape Spado bore.</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Four hours the sun his high meridian throne</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Had left, and o’er the Atlantic regions shone;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Still blacker clouds, that all the skies invade,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Draw o’er his sullied orb a dismal shade;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A lowering squall obscures the southern sky,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Before whose sweeping breath the waters fly;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Its weight the top-sails can no more sustain—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">‘Reef top-sails, reef!’ the master calls again.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The halyards and top bow-lines soon are gone,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The clue-lines and reef-tackles next they run;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The shivering sails descend; the yards are square;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Then quick aloft the ready crew repair;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The weather-earings and the lee they past,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The reefs enrolled, and every point made fast.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Their task above thus finished, they descend,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And vigilant th’ approaching squall attend;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">It comes resistless! and with foaming sweep</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Upturns the whitening surface of the deep;</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">In such a tempest, borne to deeds of death,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The wayward sisters scour the blasted heath.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The clouds, with ruin pregnant, now impend,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And storm, and cataracts tumultuous blend.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Deep, on her side, the reeling vessel lies:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">‘Brail up the mizen quick!’ the master cries,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">‘Man the clue-garnets! let the main-sheet fly!’</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">It rends in thousand shivering shreds on high!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The main-sail all in streaming ruins tore,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Loud fluttering, imitates the thunder’s roar:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The ship still labours in th’ oppressive strain,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Low bending, as if ne’er to rise again.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">‘Bear up the helm a-weather!’ Rodmond cries;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Swift at the word the helm a-weather flies;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">She feels its guiding power, and veers apace,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And now the fore-sail right athwart they brace:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With equal sheets restrained, the bellying sail</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Spreads a broad concave to the sweeping gale.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">While o’er the foam the ship impetuous flies,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The helm th’ attentive timoneer applies:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As in pursuit along th’ aërial way</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With ardent eye the falcon marks his prey.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Each motion watches of the doubtful chace,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Obliquely wheeling through the fluid space;</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">So, governed by the steersman’s glowing hands,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The regent helm her motion still commands.</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">But now, the transient squall to leeward past,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Again she rallies to the sullen blast:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The helm to starboard moves; each shivering sail</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Is sharply trimmed to clasp th’ augmenting gale—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The mizen draws; she springs aloof once more,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">While the forestay-sail balances before.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The fore-sail braced obliquely to the wind,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">They near the prow th’ extended tack confin’d;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Then on the leeward sheet the seamen bend,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And haul the bow-line to the bowsprit-end:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To top-sails next they haste: the bunt-lines gone!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Through rattling blocks the clue-lines swiftly run;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Th’ extending sheets on either side are mann’d,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Abroad they come! the fluttering sails expand;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The yards again ascend each comrade mast,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The leeches taught, the halyards are made fast,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The bow-lines hauled, and yards to starboard braced,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And straggling ropes in pendant order placed.</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">The main-sail, by the squall so lately rent,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In streaming pendants flying, is unbent:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With brails refixed, another soon prepared,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Ascending, spreads along beneath the yard.</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">To each yard-arm the head-rope they extend,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And soon their earings and their robans bend.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That task performed, they first the braces slack,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Then to the chesstree drag th’ unwilling tack,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And, while the lee clue-garnet’s lowered away,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Taught aft the sheet they tally, and belay.</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Now to the north, from Afric’s burning shore,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A troop of porpoises their course explore;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In curling wreaths they gambol on the tide,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Now bound aloft, now down the billow glide:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Their tracks awhile the hoary waves retain,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That burn in sparkling trails along the main—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">These fleetest coursers of the finny race,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When threatening clouds th’ ethereal vault deface,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Their route to leeward still sagacious form,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To shun the fury of th’ approaching storm.</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">III. Fair Candia now no more beneath her lee</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Protects the vessel from th’ insulting sea;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Round her broad arms impatient of control,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Roused from the secret deep, to billows roll:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Sunk were the bulwarks of the friendly shore,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And all the scene an hostile aspect wore.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The flattering wind, that late with promised aid</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Tost on the tide she feels the tempest blow,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And dreads the vengeance of so fell a foe—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As the proud horse with costly trappings gay,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Exulting, prances to the bloody fray;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Spurning the ground he glories in his might,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But reels tumultuous in the shock of fight:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">E’en so, caparisoned in gaudy pride,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The bounding vessel dances on the tide.</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Fierce and more fierce the gathering tempest grew,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">South, and by west, the threatening demon blew;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Auster’s resistless force all air invades,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And every rolling wave more ample spreads:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The ship no longer can her top-sails bear;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">No hopes of milder weather now appear.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Bowlines and halyards are cast off again,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Clue-lines hauled down, and sheets let fly amain:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Embrailed each top-sail, and by braces squar’d,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The seamen climb aloft, and man each yard;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">They furled the sails, and pointed to the wind</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The yards, by rolling tackles then confin’d,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">While o’er the ship the gallant boatswain flies;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Like a hoarse mastiff through the storm he cries,</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Prompt to direct th’ unskilful still appears,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Now some, to strike top-gallant yards attend, <span class="bracket">}</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Some, trav’llers up the weather-back stays send, <span class="bracket">}</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">At each mast-head the top-ropes others bend: <span class="bracket">}</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The parrels, lifts, and clue-lines soon are gone,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Topped and unrigged, they down the back-stays run;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The yards secure along the booms were laid,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And all the flying ropes aloft belay’d:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Their sails reduced, and all the rigging clear,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Awhile the crew relax from toils severe;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Awhile their spirits, with fatigue opprest,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In vain expect th’ alternate hour of rest—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But with redoubling force the tempests blow,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And watery hills in dread succession flow;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A dismal shade o’ercast the frowning skies,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">New troubles grow; fresh difficulties rise;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">No season this from duty to descend,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">‘All hands on deck’ must now the storm attend.</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">His race performed, the sacred lamp of day</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Now dipt in western clouds his parting ray:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His languid fires, half lost in ambient haze,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Refract along the dusk a crimson blaze;</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Till deep immerged the sickening orb descends,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And cheerless night o’er heaven her reign extends;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Sad evening’s hour, how different from the past!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">No flaming pomp, no blushing glories cast,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">No ray of friendly light is seen around;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The moon and stars in hopeless shade are drown’d.</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">The ship no longer can whole courses bear,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To reef them now becomes the master’s care;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The sailors, summoned aft, all ready stand,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And man th’ enfolding brails at his command:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But here the doubtful officers dispute,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Till skill, and judgment prejudice confute:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For Rodmond, to new methods still a foe,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Would first, at all events, the sheet let go;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To long-tried practice obstinately warm,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He doubts conviction, and relies on form.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">This Albert and Arion disapprove,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And first to brail the tack up firmly move:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">‘The watchful seaman, whose sagacious eye</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">On sure experience may with truth rely,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Who from the reigning cause foretels th’ effect,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">This barbarous practice ever will reject:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For, fluttering loose in air, the rigid sail</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Soon flits to ruins in the furious gale;</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">And he, who strives the tempest to disarm,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Will never first embrail the lee yard-arm.’</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">So Albert spoke; to windward, at his call,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Some seamen the clue-garnet stand to haul—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The tack’s eased off, while the involving clue</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Between the pendent blocks ascending flew;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The sheet and weather-brace they now stand by,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The lee clue-garnet, and the bunt-lines ply;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Then, all prepared, ‘Let go the sheet!’ he cries—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Loud rattling, jarring, through the blocks it flies!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Shivering at first, till by the blast impelled,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">High o’er the lee yard-arm the canvass swelled;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">By spilling lines embraced, with brails confined,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">It lies at length unshaken by the wind.</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Watching the roll, their forelocks they withdrew,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">To equal votes our counsels I resign—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Forbid it, Heaven! that in this dreadful hour</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I claim the dangerous reins of purblind power!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But should we now resolve to bear away,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Our hopeless state can suffer no delay:</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Nor can we, thus bereft of every sail,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Attempt to steer obliquely on the gale:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For then, if broaching sideway to the sea,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Our dropsied ship may founder by the lee;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Vain all endeavours then to bear away,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Nor helm, nor pilot, would she more obey.”</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">He said: the listening mates with fixed regard,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And silent reverence, his opinion heard;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Important was the question in debate,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And o’er their counsels hung impending fate:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Rodmond, in many a scene of peril tried,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Had oft the master’s happier skill descried,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Yet now, the hour, the scene, th’ occasion known,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Perhaps with equal right preferred his own;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of long experience in the naval art,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Blunt was his speech, and naked was his heart;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Alike to him each climate, and each blast,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The first in danger, in retreat the last:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Sagacious, balancing th’ opposed events,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">From Albert his opinion thus dissents.—</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">“Too true the perils of the present hour,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Where toils succeeding toils our strength o’erpower!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Our bark, ’tis true, no shelter here can find,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Sore shattered by the ruffian seas and wind:</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Yet where with safety can we dare to scud</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Before this tempest, and pursuing flood?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">At random driven, to present death we haste,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And one short hour perhaps may be our last:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Though Corinth’s gulf extend along the lee,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To whose safe ports appears a passage free,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Yet think! this furious unremitting gale</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Deprives the ship of every ruling sail;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And if before it she directly flies,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">New ills enclose us, and new dangers rise:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Here Falconera spreads her lurking snares,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">There distant Greece her rugged shelves prepares;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Our hull, if once it strikes that iron coast,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Asunder bursts, in instant ruin lost;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Nor she alone, but with her all the crew,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Beyond relief, are doomed to perish too:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Such mischiefs follow if we bear away;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">O safer that sad refuge—to delay!</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">“Then of our purpose this appears the scope,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To weigh the danger with the doubtful hope:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Though sorely buffeted by every sea,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Our hull unbroken long may try a-lee;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The crew, though harassed much with toils severe,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Still at their pumps, perceive no hazards near:</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Shall we, incautious, then the danger tell,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">At once their courage and their hope to quell?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Prudence forbids! this southern tempest soon</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">May change its quarter with the changing moon;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Its rage, though terrible, may soon subside,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Nor into mountains lash th’ unruly tide:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">These leaks shall then decrease—the sails once more</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Direct our course to some relieving shore.”</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Thus while he spoke, around from man to man</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">At either pump a hollow murmur ran:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For, while the vessel through unnumbered chinks,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Above, below, th’ invading water drinks,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Sounding her depth they eyed the wetted scale,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And lo! the leaks o’er all their powers prevail:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Yet at their post, by terrors unsubdued,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">They with redoubling force their task pursued.</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And now the senior pilots seemed to wait</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Arion’s voice, to close the dark debate:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Not o’er his vernal life the ripening sun</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Had yet, progressive, twice ten summers run;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Slow to debate, yet eager to excel,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In thy sad school, stern Neptune! taught too well:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With lasting pain to rend his youthful heart</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Dire Fate in venom dipt her keenest dart;</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Till his firm spirit, tempered long to ill,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Forgot her persecuting scourge to feel:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But now the horrors, that around him roll,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thus roused to action his rekindling soul:</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">“Can we, delayed in this tremendous tide,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A moment pause what purpose to decide?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Alas! from circling horrors thus combined,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">One method of relief alone we find:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thus water-logged, thus helpless to remain</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Amid this hollow, how ill-judged! how vain!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Our sea-breach’d vessel can no longer bear</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The floods, that o’er her burst in dread career;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The labouring hull already seems half-filled</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With water through an hundred leaks distilled;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thus drenched by every wave, her riven deck,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Stript, and defenceless, floats a naked wreck;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">At every pitch th’ o’erwhelming billows bend</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Beneath their load the quivering bowsprit’s end;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A fearful warning! since the masts on high</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">On that support with trembling hope rely;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">At either pump our seamen pant for breath,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In dire dismay, anticipating death;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Still all our powers th’ increasing leaks defy,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">We sink at sea, no shore, no haven nigh:</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">One dawn of hope yet breaks athwart the gloom</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To light and save us from a watery tomb;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That bids us shun the death impending here,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Fly from the following blast, and shoreward steer.</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">“’Tis urged indeed, the fury of the gale</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Precludes the help of every guiding sail;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And, driven before it on the watery waste,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To rocky shores and scenes of death we haste;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But haply Falconera we may shun,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And long to Grecian coasts is yet the run:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Less harassed then, our scudding ship may bear</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Th’ assaulting surge repelled upon her rear,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And since as soon that tempest may decay,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When steering shoreward—wherefore thus delay?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Should we at last be driven by dire decree</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Too near the fatal margin of the sea,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The hull dismasted there awhile may ride,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With lengthened cables, on the raging tide;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Perhaps kind Heaven, with interposing power,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">May curb the tempest ere that dreadful hour;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But here, ingulfed and foundering, while we stay,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Fate hovers o’er, and marks us for her prey.”</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">He said: Palemon saw with grief of heart,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The storm prevailing o’er the pilot’s art;</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">In silent terror and distress involved,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He heard their last alternative resolved:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">High beat his bosom—with such fear subdued,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Beneath the gloom of some enchanted wood,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Oft in old time the wandering swain explored</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The midnight wizards, breathing rites abhorred;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Trembling, approached their incantations fell,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And, chilled with horror, heard the songs of hell.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Arion saw, with secret anguish moved,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The deep affliction of the friend he loved,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And all awake to Friendship’s genial heat</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His bosom felt consenting tremors beat!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Alas! no season this for tender love,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Far hence the music of the myrtle grove—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He tried with soft persuasion’s melting lore</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Palemon’s fainting courage to restore;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His wounded spirit healed with friendship’s balm,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And bade each conflict of the mind be calm.</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Now had the pilots all th’ events revolved,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And on their final refuge thus resolved—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When, like the faithful shepherd who beholds</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Some prowling wolf approach his fleecy folds,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To the brave crew, whom racking doubts perplex,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The dreadful purpose Albert thus directs:</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span>
    <div class="verse indent2">“Unhappy partners in a wayward fate!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Whose courage now is known perhaps too late;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Ye! who unmoved behold this angry storm</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In conflict all the rolling deep deform;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Who, patient in adversity, still bear</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The firmest front when greatest ills are near;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The truth, though painful, I must now reveal,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That long in vain I purposed to conceal:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Ingulfed, all help of art we vainly try,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To weather leeward shores, alas! too nigh:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Our crazy bark no longer can abide</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The seas, that thunder o’er her battered side;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And while the leaks a fatal warning give</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That in this raging sea she cannot live,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">One only refuge from despair we find—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">At once to wear and scud before the wind:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Perhaps e’en then to ruin we may steer, <span class="bracket">}</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For rocky shores beneath our lee appear; <span class="bracket">}</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But that’s remote, and instant death is here: <span class="bracket">}</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Yet there, by Heaven’s assistance, we may gain</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Some creek or inlet of the Grecian main;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Or, sheltered by some rock, at anchor ride</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Till with abating rage the blast subside:</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">But if, determined by the will of Heaven,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Our helpless bark at last ashore is driven,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">These counsels followed, from a watery grave</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Our crew perhaps amid the surf may save:—</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">“And first, let all our axes be secured,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To cut the masts and rigging from aboard;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Then to the quarters bind each plank and oar</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To float between the vessel and the shore:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The longest cordage too must be conveyed</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">On deck, and to the weather-rails belayed:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">So they, who haply reach alive the land,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Th’ extended lines may fasten on the strand,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Whene’er, loud thundering on the leeward shore,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">While yet aloof, we hear the breakers roar:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thus for the terrible event prepar’d,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Brace fore and aft to starboard every yard;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">So shall our masts swim lighter on the wave,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And from the broken rocks our seamen save;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Then westward turn the stem, that every mast</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">May shoreward fall as from the vessel cast.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When o’er her side once more the billows bound,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Ascend the rigging till she strikes the ground;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And, when you hear aloft the dreadful shock</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That strikes her bottom on some pointed rock,</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">The boldest of our sailors must descend</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The dangerous business of the deck to tend:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Then burst the hatches off, and every stay</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And every fastening laniard cut away;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Planks, gratings, booms, and rafts to leeward cast,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Then with redoubled strokes attack each mast,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That buoyant lumber may sustain you o’er</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The rocky shelves and ledges to the shore:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But as your firmest succour, till the last,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">O cling securely on each faithful mast!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Though great the danger, and the task severe,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Yet bow not to the tyranny of fear;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">If once that slavish yoke your souls subdue,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Adieu to hope! to life itself adieu!</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">“I know among you some have oft beheld</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A bloodhound train, by rapine’s lust impell’d,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">On England’s cruel coast impatient stand,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To rob the wanderers wrecked upon their strand:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">These, while their savage office they pursue,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Oft wound to death the helpless plundered crew,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Who, ’scaped from every horror of the main,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Implored their mercy, but implored in vain:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Yet dread not this, a crime to Greece unknown,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Such bloodhounds all her circling shores disown;</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Who, though by barb’rous tyranny opprest,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Can share affliction with the wretch distrest:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Their hearts, by cruel fate inured to grief,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Oft to the friendless stranger yield relief.”</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">With conscious horror struck, the naval band</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Deserted for a while their native land;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">They cursed the sleeping vengeance of the laws,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That thus forgot her guardian sailors’ cause.</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Meanwhile the master’s voice again they heard,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Whom, as with filial duty, all revered:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">“No more remains—but now a trusty band</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Must ever at the pumps industrious stand;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And, while with us the rest attend to wear,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Two skilful seamen to the helm repair—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And Thou, Eternal Power! whose awful sway,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The storms revere, and roaring seas obey!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">On thy supreme assistance we rely;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thy mercy supplicate, if doomed to die!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Perhaps this storm is sent with healing breath</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">From neighb’ring shores to scourge disease and death:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">’Tis ours on thine unerring laws to trust,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With thee, great Lord! ‘whatever is, is just.’”</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>
    <div class="verse indent2">He said: and, with consenting reverence fraught,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The sailors joined his prayer in silent thought:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His intellectual eye, serenely bright,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Saw distant objects with prophetic light—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thus in a land, that lasting wars oppress,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That groans beneath misfortune and distress;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Whose wealth to conquering armies falls a prey,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Till all her vigour, pride, and fame decay;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Some bold sagacious statesman, from the helm,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Sees desolation gathering o’er his realm;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He darts around his penetrating eyes,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Where dangers grow, and hostile unions rise;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With deep attention marks th’ invading foe,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Eludes their wiles and frustrates every blow,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Tries his last art the tottering state to save,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Or in its ruins find a glorious grave.</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Still in the yawning trough the vessel reels,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Ingulphed beneath two fluctuating hills;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">On either side they rise, tremendous scene!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A long dark melancholy vale between:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The balanced ship now forward, now behind, <span class="bracket">}</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Still felt th’ impression of the waves and wind, <span class="bracket">}</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And to the right and left by turns inclin’d; <span class="bracket">}</span></div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">But Albert from behind the balance drew,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And on the prow its double efforts threw.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The order now was given to bear away!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The order given, the timoneers obey:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Both stay-sails sheets to mid-ships were conveyed,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And round the foremast on each side belayed;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thus ready, to the halyards they apply,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">They hoist! away the flitting ruins fly:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Yet Albert new resources still prepares,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Conceals his grief, and doubles all his cares.—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">“Away there! lower the mizen-yard on deck,”</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He calls, “and brace the foremast yards aback!”</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His great example every bosom fires,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">New life enkindles, and new hope inspires.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">While to the helm unfaithful still she lies,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">One desperate remedy at last he tries—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">“Haste! with your weapons cut the shrouds and stay,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And hew at once the mizen-mast away!”</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He said: to cut the girding stay they run,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Soon on each side the severed shrouds are gone:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Fast by the fated pine bold Rodmond stands,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Th’ impatient axe hung gleaming in his hands;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Brandished on high, it fell with dreadful sound,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The tall mast groaning felt the deadly wound;</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Deep gashed beneath, the tottering structure rings,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And crashing, thundering, o’er the quarter swings:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thus, when some limb, convulsed with pangs of death,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Imbibes the gangrene’s pestilential breath,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Th’ experienced artist from the blood betrays</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The latent venom, or its course delays;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But if th’ infection triumphs o’er his art,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Tainting the vital stream that warms the heart,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To stop the course of death’s inflaming tides,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Th’ infected member from the trunk divides.</div>

<h3>CANTO III.</h3>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">I. When in a barbarous age, with blood defil’d,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The human savage roamed the gloomy wild;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When sullen Ignorance her flag displayed,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And Rapine, and Revenge her voice obeyed;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Sent from the shores of light the Muses came</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The dark and solitary race to tame,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The war of lawless passions to controul,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To melt in tender sympathy the soul;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The heart’s remote recesses to explore,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And touch its springs when prose availed no more:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The kindling spirit caught th’ empyreal ray,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And glowed congenial with the swelling lay;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Roused from the chaos of primeval night,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">At once fair Truth and Reason sprung to light.</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">When great Mæonides, in rapid song,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The thundering tide of battle rolls along,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Each ravished bosom feels the high alarms,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And all the burning pulses beat to arms;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Hence, War’s terrific glory to display,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Became the theme of every epic lay:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But when his strings with mournful magic tell</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">What dire distress Laertes’ son befel,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The strains meand’ring through the maze of woe</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Bid sacred sympathy the heart o’erflow;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Far through the boundless realms of thought he springs,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">From earth upborne on Pegasean wings,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">While distant poets, trembling as they view</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His sunward flight, the dazzling track pursue;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His magic voice that rouses and delights,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Allures and guides to climb Olympian heights:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But I, alas! through scenes bewildered stray,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Far from the light of his unerring ray;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">While, all unused the wayward path to tread,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Darkling I wander with prophetic dread;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To me in vain the bold Mæonian lyre</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Awakes the numbers fraught with living fire;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Full oft indeed that mournful harp of yore</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Wept the sad wanderer lost upon the shore;</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">’Tis true he lightly sketched the bold design,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But toils more joyless, more severe are mine;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Since o’er that scene his genius swiftly ran,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Subservient only to a nobler plan:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But I, perplexed in labyrinths of art,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Anatomize, and blazon every part;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Attempt with plaintive numbers to display,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And chain th’ events in regular array;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Though hard the task to sing in varied strains,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When still unchanged the same sad theme remains;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">O could it draw compassion’s melting tear</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For kindred miseries, oft beheld too near!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For kindred wretches, oft in ruin cast</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">On Albion’s strand beneath the wintery blast;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For all the pangs, the complicated woe,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Her bravest sons, her guardian sailors know;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Then every breast should sigh at our distress—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">This were the summit of my hoped success!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For this, my theme through mazes I pursue,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Which nor Mæonides, nor Maro knew.</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">II. Awhile the mast, in ruins dragged behind,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Balanced th’ impression of the helm and wind;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The wounded serpent, agonized with pain,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thus trails his mangled volume on the plain:</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">But now, the wreck dissevered from the rear,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The long reluctant prow began to veer;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">While round before th’ enlarging wind it falls,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">“Square fore and aft the yards,” the master calls:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">“You timoneers her motion still attend,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For on your steerage all our lives depend:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">So, steady! meet her! watch the curving prow,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And from the gale directly let her go.”</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">“Starboard again!” the watchful pilot cries,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">“Starboard!” th’ obedient timoneer replies:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Then back to port, revolving at command,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The wheel rolls swiftly through each glowing hand.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The ship no longer, foundering by the lee,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Bears on her side the invasions of the sea;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">All lonely o’er the desert waste she flies,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Scourged on by surges, storms, and bursting skies:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As when enclosing harpooners assail</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In Hyperborean seas the slumb’ring whale,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Soon as their javelins pierce his scaly side,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He groans, he darts impetuous down the tide;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And racked all o’er with lacerating pain,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He flies remote beneath the flood in vain—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">So with resistless haste the wounded ship</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Scuds from pursuing waves along the deep;</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">While, dashed apart by her dividing prow,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Like burning adamant the waters glow;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Her joints forget their firm elastic tone,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Her long keel trembles, and her timbers groan:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Upheaved behind her in tremendous height</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The billows frown, with fearful radiance bright:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Now quivering o’er the topmost wave she rides,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">While deep beneath th’ enormous gulf divides;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Now launching headlong down the horrid vale,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Becalmed, she hears no more the howling gale;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Till up the dreadful height again she flies,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Trembling beneath the current of the skies:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As that rebellious angel, who, from heaven,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To regions of eternal pain was driven,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When dreadless he forsook the Stygian shore</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The distant realms of Eden to explore;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Here, on sulphureous clouds sublime upheaved,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With daring wing th’ infernal air he cleaved;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">There, in some hideous gulf descending prone,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Far in the void abrupt of night was known—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">E’en so she climbs the briny mountain’s height,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Then down the black abyss precipitates her flight:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The masts, about whose tops the whirlwinds sing,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With long vibration round her axle swing.</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span>
    <div class="verse indent2">To guide her wayward course amid the gloom,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The watchful pilots different posts assume:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Albert and Rodmond on the poop appear,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">There to direct each guiding timoneer;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">While at the bow the watch Arion keeps,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To shun what cruisers wander o’er the deeps:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Where’er he moves Palemon still attends,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As if on him his only hope depends;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">While Rodmond, fearful of some neighbouring shore,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Cries, ever and anon, ‘Look out afore!’</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Thus o’er the flood four hours she scudding flew,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When Falconera’s rugged cliffs they view,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Faintly along the larboard bow descried,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As o’er its mountain tops the lightnings glide;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">High o’er its summit, through the gloom of night,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The glimmering watch tower cast a mournful light:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In dire amazement rivetted they stand,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And hear the breakers lash the rugged strand—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But scarce perceived, when past the beam it flies,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Swift as the rapid eagle cleaves the skies;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That danger past reflects a feeble joy,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But soon returning fears their hope destroy;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As in th’ Atlantic Ocean, when we find</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Some alp of ice driv’n southward by the wind,</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">The sultry air all sickening pants around,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In deluges of torrid ether drown’d;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Till when the floating isle approaches nigh,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In cooling tides th’ aërial billows fly:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Awhile delivered from the scorching heat,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In gentler tides our feverish pulses beat:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Such transient pleasure, as they passed this strand,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A moment bade their throbbing hearts expand;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Th’ illusive meteors of a lifeless fire,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Too soon they kindle, and too soon expire.</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">III. Say, Memory! thou, from whose unerring tongue</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Instructive flows the animated song,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">What regions now the scudding ship surround?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Regions of old through all the world renown’d;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That, once the Poet’s theme, the Muses’ boast,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Now lie in ruins, in oblivion lost!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Did they, whose sad distress these lays deplore, <span class="bracket">}</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Unskilled in Grecian, or in Roman lore, <span class="bracket">}</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Unconscious pass along each famous shore? <span class="bracket">}</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">They did: for in this desert, joyless soil,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">No flowers of genial science deign to smile;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Sad ocean’s genius, in untimely hour,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Withers the bloom of every springing flower;</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">For native tempests here with blasting breath,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Despoil, and doom the vernal buds to death;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Here fancy droops, while sullen clouds, and storm,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The generous temper of the soul deform:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Then, if among the wandering naval train,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">One stripling, exiled from th’ Aonian plain,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Had e’er, entranced in Fancy’s soothing dream,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Approached to taste the sweet Castalian stream;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">(Since those salubrious streams, with power divine,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To purer sense the softened soul refine)</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Sure he, amid unsocial mates immured,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To learning lost, severer grief endured;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In vain might Phœbus’ ray his mind inspire,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Since Fate with torrents quenched the kindling fire:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">If one this pain of living death possess’d,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">It dwelt supreme, Arion! in thy breast;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When, with Palemon, watching in the night</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Beneath pale Cynthia’s melancholy light,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">You oft recounted those surrounding states,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Whose glory Fame with brazen tongue relates.</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Immortal Athens first, in ruin spread,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Contiguous lies at Port Liono’s head;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Great source of science! whose immortal name</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Stands foremost in the glorious roll of Fame;</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Here god-like Socrates, and Plato shone,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And, firm to truth, eternal honour won;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The first in Virtue’s cause his life resigned,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">By Heaven pronounced the wisest of mankind;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The last proclaimed the spark of vital fire,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The Soul’s fine essence, never could expire;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Here Solon dwelt, the philosophic sage</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That fled Pisistratus’ vindictive rage;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Just Aristides here maintained the cause,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Whose sacred precepts shine through Solon’s laws:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of all her towering structures, now alone</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Some columns stand, with mantling weeds o’ergrown;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The wandering stranger near the port descries</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A milk-white lion of stupendous size,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of antique marble; hence the haven’s name,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Unknown to modern natives whence it came.</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Next, in the gulf of Engia, Corinth lies,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Whose gorgeous fabrics seemed to strike the skies;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Whom, though by tyrant victors oft subdued,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Greece, Egypt, Rome, with admiration viewed:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Her name, for architecture long renown’d,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Spread like the foliage which her pillars crowned;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But now, in fatal desolation laid,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Oblivion o’er it draws a dismal shade.</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span>
    <div class="verse indent2">Then further westward, on Morea’s land,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Fair Misitra! thy modern turrets stand:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Ah! who, unmoved with secret woe, can tell</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That here great Lacedæmon’s glory fell;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Here once she flourished, at whose trumpet’s sound</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">War burst his chains, and nations shook around;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Here brave Leonidas from shore to shore</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Through all Achaia bade her thunders roar:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He, when imperial Xerxes from afar</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Advanced with Persia’s sumless hosts to war,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Till Macedonia shrunk beneath his spear,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And Greece all shuddered as the chief drew near;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He, at Thermopylæ’s decisive plain,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Their force opposed with Sparta’s glorious train;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Tall Oeta saw the tyrant’s conquered bands</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In gasping millions bleed on hostile lands:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thus vanquished, haughty Asia heard thy name,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And Thebes, and Athens, sickened at thy fame;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thy state, supported by Lycurgus’ laws,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Gained, like thine arms, superlative applause;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">E’en great Epaminondas strove in vain</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To curb thy spirit with a Theban chain:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But ah! how low that free-born spirit now!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thy abject sons to haughty tyrants bow;</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">A false, degenerate, superstitious race</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Invest thy region, and its name disgrace.</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Not distant far, Arcadia’s blest domains</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Peloponnesus’ circling shore contains:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thrice happy soil! where still serenely gay,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Indulgent Flora breathed perpetual May:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Where buxom Ceres bade each fertile field</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Spontaneous gifts in rich profusion yield;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Then, with some rural nymph supremely blest,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">While transport glowed in each enamoured breast,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Each faithful shepherd told his tender pain,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And sung of sylvan sports in artless strain;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Soft as the happy swain’s enchanting lay</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That pipes among ‘The Shades of Endermay:’</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Now, sad reverse! Oppression’s iron hand</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Enslaves her natives, and despoils her land;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In lawless rapine bred, a sanguine train,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With midnight ravage, scour th’ uncultured plain.</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Westward of these, beyond the Isthmus, lies</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The long sought Isle of Ithacus the wise;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Where fair Penelope, of him deprived,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To guard her honour endless schemes contrived:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">She, only shielded by her stripling son,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Her lord Ulysses long to Ilion gone,</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Each bold attempt of suitor-kings repell’d,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And undefiled her nuptial contract held;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">True to her vows, and resolutely chaste,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Met arts with art, and triumphed at the last.</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Argos, in Greece forgotten and unknown,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Still seems her cruel fortune to bemoan:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Argos, whose monarch led the Grecian hosts</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Across th’ Ægean main to Dardan coasts:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Unhappy prince! who, on a hostile shore,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Fatigue, and danger, ten long winters bore;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And when to native realms restored at last</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To reap the harvest of thy labours past,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">There found a perjured friend, and faithless wife,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Who sacrificed to impious lust thy life:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Fast by Arcadia stretch these desert plains,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And o’er the land a gloomy tyrant reigns.</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Next Macronisi is adjacent seen,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Where adverse winds detained the Spartan queen;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For whom, in arms combined, the Grecian host,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With vengeance fired, invaded Phrygia’s coast;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For whom so long they laboured to destroy</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The lofty turrets of imperial Troy;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Here driven by Juno’s rage, the hapless dame,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">The port an image bears of Parian stone,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of ancient fabric, but of date unknown.</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Due east from this appears th’ immortal shore</div>

    <div class="verse indent2">Now, through the parting wave impetuous bore,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The scudding vessel stemmed th’ Athenian shore;</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Superior armies that around them close;</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">From wintery magazines that sweep the sky,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Th’ ethereal dome in mournful pomp array’d</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Now buried lies beneath impervious shade,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Now, flashing round intolerable light,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Redoubles all the horror of the night—</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Th’ inflaming sulphur flashing from his wings;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Hark! his strong voice the dismal silence breaks,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Mad Chaos from the chains of death awakes:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Loud, and more loud, the rolling peals enlarge,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And blue on deck the fiery tides discharge;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">There all aghast the shivering wretches stood,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">E’en now my ear with quick vibration feels</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Th’ explosion burst in strong rebounding peals;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Swift through my pulses glides the kindling fire,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As lightning glances on th’ electric wire:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Yet ah! the languid colours vainly strive</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To bid the scene in native hues revive.</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">But lo! at last, from tenfold darkness born,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Forth issues o’er the wave the weeping morn:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Hail, sacred Vision! who, on orient wings,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The cheering dawn of light propitious brings;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">All nature smiling hailed the vivid ray</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That gave her beauties to returning day,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">For now in front her trembling inmates see</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The hills of Greece emerging on the lee—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">So the lost lover views that fatal morn,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">On which for ever from his bosom torn,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The maid adored resigns her blooming charms,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To bless with love some happier rival’s arms;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">So to Eliza dawned that cruel day</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That tore Æneas from her sight away,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That saw him parting never to return,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Herself in funeral flames decreed to burn.</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">O yet in clouds, thou genial Source of Light!</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Go, with thy smile adorn thy happy plain,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And gild the scenes where health and pleasure reign:</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Full in her van St. George’s Cliffs arise;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">High o’er the rest a pointed crag is seen,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That hung projecting o’er a mossy green;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Huge breakers on the larboard bow appear,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And full a-head its eastern ledges bear:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To steer more eastward Albert still commands,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And shun, if possible, the fatal strands—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Nearer and nearer now the danger grows,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">For while more eastward they direct the prow,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Enormous waves the quivering deck o’erflow;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">While, as she wheels, unable to subdue</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Her trembling side could bear the mountained sea,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And if pursuing waves she scuds before,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Headlong she runs upon the frightful shore;</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">A shore, where shelves and hidden rocks abound,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Where death in secret ambush lurks around:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Not half so dreadful to Æneas’ eyes</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The Straits of Sicily were seen to rise,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When Palinurus from the helm descry’d,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The Rocks of Scylla on his eastern side,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">While in the west, with hideous yawn disclosed,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His onward path Charybdis’ gulph opposed;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The double danger he alternate viewed,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And cautiously his arduous track pursued:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thus, while to right and left destruction lies,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">With terrible irruption bursting o’er</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The marble cliffs, tremendous surges roar;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Hoarse thro’ each winding creek the tempest raves,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And hollow rocks repeat the groan of waves:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Should once the bottom strike this cruel shore,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Nor she alone, but with her all the crew</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Though scarce her length in distance from the land;</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Happy to bribe with India’s richest ore</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A safe accession to that barren shore—</div>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>A <i>bar</i> is known, in hydrography, to be a mass of earth,
or sand, that has been collected by the surge of the sea,
at the entrance of a river, or haven, so as to render navigation
difficult, and often dangerous. A <i>shelf</i>, or <i>shelve</i>,
so called from the Saxon <i>Schylf</i>, is a name given to any
dangerous shallows, sand-banks, or rocks, lying immediately
under the surface of the water.</p>

<h4><a href="#Page_52"><span class="smcap">Page 52</span></a>, l. 10.</h4>

<p>The <i>windlass</i> is a large cylindrical piece of timber used
in merchant ships to heave up the anchors: it is furnished<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[148]</span>
with strong iron <i>pauls</i> to prevent it from turning back by
the efforts of the cable, when charged with the weight of
the anchor, or strained by the violent jerking of the ship
in a tempestuous sea. As the <i>windlass</i> is heaved about in
a vertical direction, it is evident that the effort of an
equal number of men acting upon it will be much more
powerful than on the <i>capstan</i>. It requires, however,
some dexterity and address to manage the handspec, or
lever, to the greatest advantage; and to perform this the
sailors must all rise at once upon the <i>windlass</i>, and, fixing
their bars therein, give a sudden jerk at the same instant;
in which movement they are regulated by a sort of song
pronounced by one of the number. The most dexterous
managers of the <i>handspec</i>, in heaving at the <i>windlass</i>, are
generally supposed to be the colliers of Northumberland;
and of all European mariners, the Dutch are certainly the
most awkward and sluggish in this manœuvre.</p>

the present instance, when a ship for want of wind is
forced toward the shore by the swell of the sea.</p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>1. <i>Stud</i>, or <i>studding-sails</i>, called by the French <i>Banettes
en etui</i>, are light sails, which are extended in moderate
breezes beyond the skirts of the principal sails: where
they appear as wings upon the yard-arms. 2. <i>Stay-sail</i>;
though the form of sails is so extremely different, they
may all be divided into sails which have either <i>three</i> or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[149]</span>
<i>four</i> sides: a <i>stay-sail</i> comes under the first class, and receives
its name from a large strong rope on which it is
hoisted, called a stay, employed to support the mast, by
being extended from its upper end towards the fore part
of the ship, as the shrouds (a range of large ropes), are
extended to the right and left of the mast, and behind
it. The yards of a ship are said to be square, when they
hang across the ship, at right angles, with the mast; and
<i>braced</i>, when they form greater or lesser angles with the
ship’s length.</p>

</div>

<p>The magnetical <i>Azimuth</i>, a term which astronomers
have borrowed from the Arabians, is the apparent distance
of the sun from the north or south point of the compass;
and this is discovered, by observing with an azimuth
compass, when the sun is ten or fifteen degrees above
the horizon.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>Before the art of coppering ships’ bottoms was discovered,
they were painted white. The <i>wales</i> are the
strong flanks which extend along a ship’s side, at different
heights, throughout her whole length, and form the curves
by which a vessel appears light and graceful on the water:
they are usually distinguished into the main-wale, and the
channel-wale.</p>

<p>In our largest merchantmen, the <i>tops</i>, or platforms,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span>
which surround the heads of the <i>lower</i> mast, (for every
ship’s mast, taken in its apparent length, consists of the
<i>lower</i> mast, the <i>top</i>-mast, and <i>top-gallant</i> mast) are fenced
on the aft, or hinder side, by a rail of about three feet
high, stretching across, supported by stanchions; between
which a netting is usually constructed, the outside of which
was formerly covered with red baize, or canvass painted
red, and was called the <i>top armor</i>; being a sort of blind
against the enemy for the men who were there stationed.
This name is now nearly lost, and the netting is always
covered with black canvass.</p>

<h3>NOTES ON THE SECOND CANTO.</h3>

<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>And the dark scud in swift succession flies.</i></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The scud is a name given by seamen to the lowest and
lightest clouds, which are swiftly driven along the atmosphere
by the winds.</p>

    <div class="verse indent0"><i>Low in the wave the leeward cannon lie.</i></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>When the wind crosses a ship’s course, either directly or
obliquely, that side of the ship upon which it acts is
termed the <i>weather</i> side; and the opposite one, which is
then pressed downwards, is termed the <i>lee</i> side; all on one
side of her is accordingly called to windward, and all on
the opposite side to leeward: hence also are derived the
<i>lee</i> cannon, the <i>lee</i> braces, <i>weather</i> braces, &amp;c.</p>

<h4><a href="#Page_66"><span class="smcap">Page 66</span></a>, l. 24; and <a href="#Page_67"><span class="smcap">Page 67</span></a>, l. 2.</h4>

<p class="center"><i>Topsails, reef, blocks.</i></p>

<p><i>Topsails</i> are large square sails, of the second magnitude
and height; as the <i>courses</i> are of the first magnitude, and
the lowest.—<i>Reefs</i> are certain divisions of the sail, which
are taken in or let out in proportion to the increase or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[152]</span>
diminution of the wind. <i>Blocks</i> are what landsmen would
rather term, from the French word, (<i>poulie</i>) <i>pullies</i>.</p>

<h4><a href="#Page_67"><span class="smcap">Page 67</span></a>, l. 15, 16, 19.</h4>

<p class="center"><i>Halyards—bow-lines—clue-lines—reef tackles—earings.</i></p>

<p><i>Halyards</i> are those ropes by which sails are hoisted or
lowered. <i>Bow-lines</i> are ropes fastened to the outer edge
of square sails in three different places, that the windward
edge of the sail may be bound tight forward on a side
wind, in order to keep the sail from shivering. <i>Clue-lines</i>
are fastened to the lower corners of the square sails,
for the more easy furling of them. <i>Reef-tackles</i> are
ropes fastened to the edge of the sail, just beneath the
lowest reef; and being brought down to the deck by means
of two blocks, are used to facilitate the operation of reefing.
<i>Earings</i> are small ropes employed to fasten the
upper corners of the principal sails, and the extremities of
the reefs, to the respective yard-arms, particularly when
any sail is to be close furled.</p>

    <div class="verse indent0"><i>Brail up the mizen quick.</i></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The <i>mizen</i> is a large sail bent to the mizen mast, and is
commonly reckoned one of the courses, which consist of
the <i>main-sail</i>, <i>fore-sail</i>, and <i>mizen</i>. As the word <i>brails</i> is
a general name given to all the ropes which are employed
to haul up the bottoms, lower corners, and skirts of the
great sails; so the drawing them together, for the more
ready operation of furling, is called brailing them up.
The effect which the operation of brailing up the mizen
produces, is noticed in the last note of this Canto.</p>

    <div class="verse indent0"><i>Man the clue-garnets, let the main-sheet fly!</i></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p><i>Clue-garnets</i> are the same to the main-sail and fore-sail,
which the clue-lines are to all other square-sails, and are
hauled up when the sail is to be furled or <i>brailed</i>. <i>Sheets</i>:
it is necessary in this place to remark, that the sheets,
which are universally mistaken by our English poets for
the sails, are in reality the ropes that are used to extend
the clues, or lower corners of the sails, to which they are
attached.</p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The reason for putting the helm a-weather, or to the
side next the wind, is to make the ship veer before it
when it blows so hard that she cannot bear her side to it
any longer. <i>Veering</i>, or wearing, is the operation by
which a ship, in changing her course from one <i>board</i> to the
other, turns her stern to windward; the French term is,
<i>virer vent arriere</i>.</p>

it is of a triangular shape, and runs upon the fore top-mast
stay, over the bowsprit: it consequently has an influence
on the fore-part of the ship, as the mizen has on
the hinder part; and, when thus used together, they may<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[154]</span>
be said to balance each other. See also the last note of

<p>The main-sail and fore-sail of a ship are furnished with
a <i>tack</i> on each side, which is formed of a thick rope tapering
to the end, having a knot wrought upon the largest
extremity, by which it is firmly retained in the clue of
the sail: by this means the tack is always fastened to
windward, at the same time that the sheet extends the sail
to leeward.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Brails, head-ropes, robands.</i></p>

<p><i>Brails</i>: a general name given to all the ropes which

the edges of the sails, to strengthen and prevent them<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[155]</span>
from rending: those parts of it which are on the perpendicular
or sloping edges, are called <i>leech ropes</i>, that, at the

<p>A ship is said to be <i>water-logged</i>, when, having received

sea, as to yield without resistance to the efforts of every
wave that rushes over the deck. As in this dangerous
situation the centre of gravity is no longer fixed, but
fluctuates from place to place, the stability of the ship is
utterly lost: she is therefore almost totally deprived of
the use of her sails, which operate to overset her, or press
the head under water: hence there is no resource for the
crew, except to free her by the pumps, or to abandon her
for the boats as soon as possible.</p>

<p>“When a ship is forced by the violence of a contrary
wind to furl all her sails, if the storm increases, and the
sea continue to rise, she is often strained to so great a degree,
that, to ease her, she must be made to run before
their mutual direction; which, however, is rarely done
but in cases of the last necessity: now, as she has no head-way,
the helm is deprived of its governing power, as the
latter effect is only produced in consequence of the former:
it therefore necessarily requires an uncommon effort
to wheel, or turn her, into any different position. It
is an axiom in natural philosophy, that ‘Every body will
persevere in its state of rest, or moving uniformly in a
right line, unless it be compelled to change its state by
forces impressed; and that the change of motion is proportional
to the moving force impressed, and is made according
to the right line in which that force acts.’</p>

<p>“By this principle it is easy to conceive how a ship is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>[164]</span>
compelled to turn into any direction, by the force of the
wind acting upon her sails in lines parallel to the plane of
the horizon: for the sails may be so set, as to receive the
current of air either directly, or more or less obliquely;
and the motion communicated to the ship must of necessity
conspire with that of the wind. As therefore the ship lies
in such a situation as to have the wind and sea directly on
her side; and these increase to such an height, that she
must either founder, or scud before the storm; the aftmost
sails are first taken in, or so placed that the wind has
very little power on them: and the head-sails, or fore-mast
sails, are spread abroad, so that the whole force of
the wind is exerted on the ship’s forepart, which must
therefore of necessity yield to its impulse. The prow
being thus put in motion, its motion must conspire with
that of the wind, and will be pushed about so as to run
immediately before it; for this reason, when no more sail
can be carried, the fore-mast yards are braced aback;
that is, in such a position as to receive all the current of
air they can contain directly to perform the operation of
head-sails; and the mizen-yard is lowered to produce the
same effect as furling, or placing obliquely the aftmost
sails; and this attempt being found insufficient, the mizen-mast
is cut away, which must have been followed by the
main-mast, if the expected effect had not taken place.”</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away&#8212;you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected

</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
